There certaintly aren’t many ways in which a senior student might attempt to overcome 2020’s mobile applications market, but this is one of them. A quick research about this year’s top 10 trending ideas in app development includes the three key concepts in this thesis: Machine Learning, Internet Of Things and Beacon Technology. 

As Wassily Kandinsky, the theorist whose ideas changed the way of perceiving art, used to say: “Everything starts from a dot”. The dot that initiates the view of this paper is the well known Revolut app. The banking concept quickly progressed into a self pay software, in which a client enters a store, scans the products on his own, and checks out, all of these using the application. But then the whole painting needs its colors: proximity marketing and personalized offers. That’s how a user passing by a shop that has a beacon placed at the entry gets the privilege of being notified with the offers extracted from his own preferences. 

The theoretical content is specified in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, where the Association Rules Mining illustrates the ways of predicting a user’s shopping behaviour and respectively the approaches of locating him through Beacon technology. The third chapter consists of the most recently developed software ideas and interesting knowledge on Internet of Things and Bluetooth Low Energy devices . Chapter 4 describes the implementation process, along with the manner in which the interface operates and also the two types of users it has been designed for: the client and the shop administrator. The impediments of producing this kind of application are also mentioned in this unit. Chapter 5 is there to conclude with, where some strong spots and future improvements thoughts are being shared.

The ability to think independently and creatively is a human legacy, and it is often prone to pattern constraints. But as this paper’s Chapter 2 statements confirm, patterns are meant for machines. The beauty of exposing a lateral way of approaching software development is the way out of a repetitive programming lifestyle. The challenges of building this application were the most fascinating parts of the process. The feeling after managing to connect to a beacon and being able to dictate his behaviour is close to what a very well known song suggests: “The World is Mine”. A nice approach here seemed to be getting the user to believe the world is his too. Therefore, let him do the scanning on his own and greet his habits with discounts while he’s taking a walk outside - this is the whole philosophy behind the original manner in which this paper manages to combine beacon detection and proximity with recommendation systems.

Overall, this project emphasizes the importance of psychological factors in a software experience. It consolidates user engagement through real time personalized notifications and through granting full control to its clients.
